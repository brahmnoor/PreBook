## PreBook
A movie booking website made in HTML, PHP, MySQL and occasional snippets of Javascript. Key features -
1. User login & registeration - using PHP sessions and a MySQL database.
2. Movie booking - with seat selection, hall selection, time selection.
3. Commenting - To post reviews of a specific movie.
4. User buy history - to quickly checkout the history of tickets purchased by a user.

**Important Note - ** This is not ready for production, because it has multiple problems arising in real life (see future updates should include section). It was built as a project, and should be appropriate as a starting point.

### Future Updates should Include
*Reasons why you shouldn't put this up on a production level yet.*
1. Hashing password. Storing unsalted, unhashed passwords should be a crime.
2. Adding a payment gateway.
3. Handling simuntaneous transactions (so a way to put a seat on a sort of hold for the duration of buying).
4. Adding email verification.

#### How to set it up
1. Edit the db.php files with the details of your MySQL database.
2. Use the backup.sql file to import the backed up database to your MySQL to make sure that the database schema is similar.
3. Profit! :)
